        This however is just a demo, so there's actually nothing like that in here. Use your imagination though, what you currently have here
        is in effect a custom browser, so you could do all sorts of interesting stuff, such as using something on the local machine to
        authenticate a user, or have a web-page JS function trigger a native fucntion and send the data to a server.

        Your UI doesn't have to be local pages, they can be pages loaded from elswhere, but controled in a kiosk like experience,
        ensuring that your app is the only app running (Great for corporate client machines).

        Best of all, the core is based on the chrome web-kit engine, so you get all kinds of nice HTML5 goodness to play with.
